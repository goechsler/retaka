Single page HTML Takahashi style presentation thingy
----------------------------------------------------

Inspired by the [Takahashi method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) with some ideas stolen from [spork](https://metacpan.org/pod/Spork).

Using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Eric Meyer's Reset CSS](http://cssreset.com).

It was designed to be a single file, but you are welcome to link anything you want to it.
